## 1. The Problem It Solves

**Trust crisis in undercollateralized DeFi lending**. Current protocols treat all lending pools as black boxes where investors have no visibility into who they're lending to or how their capital is deployed. This fundamental opacity makes rational risk assessment impossible.

Pippu solves this through **isolated pool architecture** where each borrower gets their own transparent liquidity pool. Investors can see exactly which business they're funding, track that specific pool's TVL, monitor collateralization ratios in real-time, and make informed decisions based on the borrower's reputation and use case.

**What it enables**: Small businesses and DAOs can access working capital without selling equity or tokens. Investors gain granular control over credit exposure instead of being forced into pooled risk models where one default affects everyone.

**Mobile-first accessibility**: By making DeFi lending comprehensible through intuitive design accessible via Farcaster, we're removing the technical barrier that keeps 90% of potential users out of on-chain finance.

## 2. Challenges I Ran Into

**Smart contract state synchronization across isolated pools**. Each borrowing proposal creates a separate contract, but we needed real-time aggregated views for the lending marketplace. The naive approach of polling every pool contract would have made the UI unusable.

**Solution**: Implemented event-driven indexing where pool contracts emit standardized events that our subgraph captures. This allows instant querying of all pools while maintaining the security benefits of isolated contracts. Had to rebuild the contract event structure twice after discovering gas optimization conflicts.

**Minikit Frame rendering limitations**. Farcaster frames have strict size constraints and limited interactivity. Displaying complex lending data like collateralization ratios and repayment schedules within frame boundaries required aggressive UX simplification without losing critical information.

**Solution**: Designed a progressive disclosure pattern where frames show essential metrics only, with deeper analytics accessible through embeds. Spent significant time on visual hierarchy to ensure users can assess risk at a glance.

**Base Sepolia RPC instability during testing**. Encountered random transaction failures that weren't replicating on local Foundry tests, making debugging nearly impossible.

**Solution**: Implemented aggressive retry logic with exponential backoff and added transaction simulation before actual submission. Also set up monitoring to detect RPC issues proactively.

## 3. What Is Your Product's Unique Value Proposition

**Lending transparency through isolation**. While competitors bundle all loans into opaque pools, Pippu gives each borrower their own dedicated pool. This architectural choice means investors know precisely where every dollar goes and can diversify across specific businesses rather than being forced into all-or-nothing pool exposure.

**Validation**: Our alpha demonstrates this through the pool creation flow where borrowers must provide business details, collateral proof, and use case description. Lenders see this information before deploying capital. In user testing, 8/10 participants said they felt more confident lending through isolated pools versus traditional pooled models because they could evaluate each opportunity independently.

**Distribution advantage**: Integration with Farcaster means we're embedded in an existing social graph. Borrowers build reputation through their Farcaster identity, and lenders can verify social proof before committing capital. This social layer creates accountability that pure-protocol solutions lack.

The cute, approachable design isn't superficial; it's strategic. DeFi has an intimidation problem. By making lending feel friendly and understandable, we're expanding the addressable market beyond crypto-natives.

## 4. Who Is Your Target Customer

**Primary**: Small crypto-native businesses and DAOs that need working capital but refuse to sell tokens at unfavorable valuations. Companies with 50-500K monthly revenue who can collateralize 70% LTV but are shut out of traditional banking.

**Secondary**: Individual crypto investors with 10K-100K idle stablecoins seeking yield higher than Aave/Compound but who want more control than Maple/Goldfinch's institutional approach.

**Validation**: Conducted interviews with 12 small crypto projects during development. 9/12 indicated they'd previously turned to VC debt or token sales despite not wanting to because they couldn't find accessible on-chain lending. They specifically cited lack of platforms that would accept them as individual borrowers rather than requiring institutional relationships.

Tested with 15 potential lenders via prototype. Key insight: they wanted borrower-specific exposure, not pooled risk. One tester said "I trust Company X but not Company Y. Why should my returns suffer if Y defaults when I didn't lend to them?" This validated our isolated pool thesis.

The Farcaster integration targets users already comfortable with crypto but intimidated by DeFi complexity. We're converting social platform users into DeFi participants.

## 5. Who Are Your Closest Competitors and How Are You Different

**Wildcat Finance** - https://wildcat.finance/
They pioneered undercollateralized on-chain lending with customizable terms. However, Wildcat targets institutional borrowers and sophisticated lenders. Their interface assumes DeFi literacy, and they have no mobile or social integration.

**Differentiation**: Pippu is retail-first. We're building for individuals and small businesses, not funds. Our Farcaster integration means lending happens where users already spend time, not in a separate dApp they must learn. The mobile-optimized design makes participation possible for non-technical users.

**Maple Finance** - https://maple.finance/
Focuses on institutional credit with delegated underwriting through pool delegates. Minimum investments typically start at 100K.

**Differentiation**: Pippu eliminates the middleman. No pool delegates deciding who gets access. Borrowers create pools directly, lenders evaluate directly. We're democratizing both sides of the market. Our 70% collateralization creates safety without requiring institutional relationships.

**Key distinction**: Both competitors operate on Ethereum mainnet targeting institutional scale. Pippu launches on Base with Farcaster integration, explicitly prioritizing accessibility and user experience over maximum scale. We're attacking the long-tail market they ignore.

## 6. What Is Your Distribution Strategy and Why

**Farcaster-native distribution** is our core strategy. Rather than building another standalone dApp competing for attention, we're embedded in an existing social platform where our target users already spend time.

**Mechanism**: Borrowers share their lending pools as Farcaster casts. Their social graph sees the opportunity natively in their feed. Lenders can fund pools without leaving the platform. This social proof layer creates trust and discovery simultaneously.

**Why this works**: Cold-start problem is the death of lending platforms. We solve it by launching where both borrowers and lenders already congregate. A crypto founder with 5K Farcaster followers can raise capital from their community directly. This community-driven model compounds as each successful loan creates social proof for the next.

**Secondary channels**: Base ecosystem partnerships. We're applying for ecosystem grants and building relationships with other Base projects that need working capital. Their treasuries become our lender base; their operating needs become our borrower base.

**Long-term**: The isolated pool model enables white-label opportunities. Any community or protocol can embed Pippu's lending infrastructure. We become the lending rails for Base, not just another protocol.

**Why not paid acquisition**: DeFi lending requires trust. Paid ads generate awareness but not credibility. Our Farcaster strategy leverages existing social capital, which is more valuable than attention. We're building a lending network, not just user acquisition.
