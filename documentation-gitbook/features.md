# Core Features

> **"Every feature designed to bring transparency, accessibility, and trust back to DeFi lending."**

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Features

### Isolated Pool System

**What It Is:**
Each borrower gets their own dedicated liquidity pool with transparent terms, separate collateral, and individual risk profile.

**Why It Matters:**
- ‚úÖ **Granular Risk Control**: Lenders choose exactly which businesses to fund
- ‚úÖ **No Cross-Contamination**: One borrower's default cannot affect other pools
- ‚úÖ **Transparent Tracking**: Real-time visibility into pool performance and health
- ‚úÖ **Customized Terms**: Each pool can have unique interest rates and durations

**Technical Implementation:**
```solidity
// Each pool is a separate contract
LiquidityPool newPool = new LiquidityPool(
    collateralAsset,
    loanAsset,
    borrower,
    interestRate,
    loanDuration
);
```

### Factory Pattern Deployment

**What It Is:**
Standardized pool creation through a factory contract that ensures consistent parameters and security.

**Why It Matters:**
- ‚úÖ **Consistent Security**: All pools follow the same security model
- ‚úÖ **Easy Discovery**: Central registry of all active pools
- ‚úÖ **Standardized Interface**: Predictable behavior across all pools
- ‚úÖ **Gas Optimization**: Efficient deployment patterns

**Key Functions:**
```solidity
function createPoolWithMetadata(
    address collateralAsset,
    address loanAsset,
    uint256 collateralAmount,
    uint256 loanAmount,
    uint256 interestRate,
    uint256 loanDuration,
    string calldata description,
    string calldata name
) external returns (address pool);
```
